# InteractiveLessons
An Interactive lesson application guided by an avatar on screen, web based 

## The idea
The idea of the application is to help teachers in their lessons.    
Also to help studentens in their learing process.  
The goal is to create a web based application where a teacher can bring in their own lesson.  
The student can then on its own pace go through the lessons and complete them.  
The idea is also the student can configure the application to its own desire learing pattern  
I highly recommend to read the requirment list i leave in `documentation/requirements_list` for a full understanding of the application

# Branches  
The branches setup is designed as followed. But first keep in mind that this is the branch design at the start of the project.  
Its highly possible that there are maby more of multiple branches.  
If you make a new branch please name it as followed: `what_your_making+Name` to easly keep track of what others are doning in the project.  
### Master Branch  
The main branch that we try to maintain bug and issue free.  
Here is where worked out "Beta" release are pushed to from the branch called Main  
Its smart that if you want to Contriubte to make a branch from the Master or Main. Only dont to read the contributing part here after  

### Main or called Beta Branch  
After a version has been tested and all the required test has been passed you end up in this branch.  
This branch is designed to be the branch where a version from can be made and tested by either yourself or testers.
This with the underling thought that users dont always use the application as we plan.  
So they often find bugs or issues. Make sure that if there are found to use the template provided in documents:  
`documents/bugtemplate` and `documents/issuetemplate`  
### Test branch 
The branch where most of the versions go after the devs are done with programming.  
`CI Support is still coming` but keep in mind that:  
You can push with a request to the Main branch only after all of the test in the application are passed.  
Also highly keep in mind to also test by other people. This with the idea that they often find issues that test don`t.  
This also saves times in any beta release versions  
### Dev Branch  
You can see this as the branch im working in. I simply called it Dev branch since at the start i will be the only one working on the project.  
So there was no need for me to name it for example: `Login_by_api_Elise`  
Keep in mind that my branch with a high chance contains issues.  
If you want to contribute make sure to read Contributing and make a branch from the master or main.  
This with the given template name at the start of this section
