# InteractiveLessons
An Interactive lesson application guided by an avatar on screen, web based 

## The idea
The idea of the application is to help teachers in their lessons.    
Also to help studentens in their learing process.  
The goal is to create a web based application where a teacher can bring in their own lesson.  
The student can then own its own pace go through the lessons and complete them.  
The idea is also the student can configure the application to its desire learing pattern  
I highly recommend to read the requirment list i leave in `documentation/requirements` for a full understanding of the application
